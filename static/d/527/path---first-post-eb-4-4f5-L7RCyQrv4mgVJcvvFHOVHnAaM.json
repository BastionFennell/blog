The point of using Lorem\nIpsum\nis that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed\nto using\n'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.\nMany desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem\nIpsum as their default model text and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will\nuncover many web sites still in their infancy.
